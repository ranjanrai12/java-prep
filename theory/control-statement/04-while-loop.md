#### while loop

Ans: while loop is used to iterate a part of the program `repeatedly` until the specified Boolean condition is `true`.

The while loop is considered as a repeating if statement. If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use the while loop.

```java
public class WhileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i=1;
        while(i <= 10) {
            System.out.println(i);
            i++;
        }
    }
}
```
